# Gift Card Manager

Desktop application for tracking discounted gift cards, orders, inventory, sales, and analytics. The app targets Windows and will ship as a standalone `.exe` using PySide6 for the GUI and SQLite for storage.

## Features (Planned)
- Gift card inventory with CSV import/export per retailer (Doordash, Best Buy, Lowe's, Home Depot, Amazon).
- Orders module with retailer filtering, gift card allocations, balance updates, and CSV import/export.
- Physical inventory tracking tied to delivered orders and manual adjustments.
- Sales tracking with profit reporting.
- Analytics dashboard summarizing balances, status counts, and time-filtered stats.
- Accounts view covering credit cards and other payment sources.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- PySide6 (Qt GUI)
- SQLAlchemy + SQLite (data storage)
- Alembic (migrations)
- Pydantic (validation)
- Pandas (CSV import/export)
- PyInstaller (Windows packaging)
